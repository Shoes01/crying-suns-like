extends Node

# When the DRAW CARD button is drawn, it should emit a signal this this node picks up.
## This node will know which card and unit are present and all that. It will move the mission along.
## It will then emit a signal contianing the results of the battle.
## The UI will listen for the signal and update.
### The UI will not "keep record" of anything. The UI will be entirely updated based on the signal emitted.
#### I can either emit signals to update parts, or a single signal to update the entire thing.
##### Ex: a single that sends out mission, encounter, card, player, unit. I don't know which is easiest.
